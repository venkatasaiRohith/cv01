<h2>ACADEMIC WORK</h2>
<h5>Term Paper</h5>
<ul>
    <li>Title: AutonomousRobot with Artificial Vision</li>
    <li>Description: The purpose of this project is to build an Obstacle detection Robot with Inf r a-Red Sensors.This Robot  automatically  senses  thepresence  of  obstacles  in  its path  and changes its direction  of movement. The obstacle detection mechanismis done by an Infra-Red Sensor that makes  use of  light  waves  to  find  the  presenceof  anobstacles  in  its  path.This  consists  of  a Microcontroller basedcontrol  system,  battery powered DCmotors and Infra-Red sensors. The Robot  is  designed  in such a way that there is no requirementof manual attention towardsit.It makes  use 
         of  the  Infra-Redsensors  to  detect  theobstacles  and dynamically  changes  the direction</li>
</ul>
<h5>Academic project:</h5>
<ul>
    <li>Project Title:Algorithm for Lung Parenchyma Segmentation.</li>
    <li>Description: The Threshold step produces a binary image that provides a rough version of the Pulmonary 
         Parenchyma. With the closing and opening proceedings, small structurescontained in  the  pulmonary  parenchyma 
         are  eliminated  and  some  breaches  in  the  border  are  corrected. Border detection and thinning have the
          purposerespectively, of extractingthe structureâ€™sborders and thinning them to the width of a pixel. Finally, 
          the object extraction step seeks to eliminate all uninterestingobjects,  leaving  only  the  pulmonary
            parenchyma.  In some images, the nodule is adjacentto the pleura, which causes the result provided by the
             previous steps to be incorrect.For  these cases, a new step was addedto reconstruct the border breach caused by the nodule</li>
